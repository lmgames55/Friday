# Friday
This is a short python assistant (yes I called it Friday from Iron Man ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
It uses various other repositories, this allows it to play music, send out tweets and search for useful information on Wolfram Alpha.

You must have your own:
* Developer Twitter account
* Spotify developer account
* Audio input device _(no you can't use mine!)_
